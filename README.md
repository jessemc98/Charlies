###Installing packages and dependencies

After cloning the repo to your computer run the following command in your terminal: 
```
sudo npm install && bower install
```
then run 'gulp' which will watch css/js files in the src folder and automatically output concatenated and minified files to the dist folder in their appropriate folders.
`gulp` command also runs a `browser-sync` server in the dist folder.
